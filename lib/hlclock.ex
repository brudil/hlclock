  Hybrid Logical Clock

  Provides globally-unique, monotonic timestamps. Timestamps are bounded by the
  clock synchronization constraint, `max_drift`.

  In order to account for physical time drift within the system, timestamps
  should regularly be exchanged between nodes. Generate a timestamp at one node
  via HLClock.send_timestamp/1; at the other node, call HLClock.recv_timestamp/2
  with the received timestamp from the first node.

  Inspired by https://www.cse.buffalo.edu/tech-reports/2014-04.pdf
